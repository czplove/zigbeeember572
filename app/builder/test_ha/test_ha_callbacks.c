/** @brief Main Init
 *
 * This function is called from the application's main function. It gives the
 * application a chance to do any initialization required at system startup. Any
 * code that you would normally put into the top of the application's main()
 * routine should be put into this function. This is called before the clusters,
 * plugins, and the network are initialized so some functionality is not yet
 * available.
        Note: No callback in the Application Framework is
 * associated with resource cleanup. If you are implementing your application on
 * a Unix host where resource cleanup is a consideration, we expect that you
 * will use the standard Posix system calls, including the use of atexit() and
 * handlers for signals such as SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGCHLD, SIGPIPE and so on. If
 * you use the signal() function to register your signal handler, please mind
 * the returned value which may be an Application Framework function. If the
 * return value is non-null, please make sure that you call the returned
 * function from your handler to avoid negating the resource cleanup of the
 * Application Framework itself.

/** @brief Main Start
 *
 * This function is called at the start of main after the HAL has been
 * initialized.  The standard main function arguments of argc and argv are
 * passed in.  However not all platforms have support for main() function
 * arguments.  Those that do not are passed NULL for argv, therefore argv should
 * be checked for NULL before using it.  If the callback determines that the
 * program must exit, it should return true.  The value returned by main() will
 * be the value written to the returnCode pointer.  Otherwise the callback
 * should return false to let normal execution continue.
